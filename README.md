## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is designed in **three modular parts**:

### **PART 1 â€“ Emotion Recognition**
- Classifies human emotions from facial expressions using various deep learning architectures.
- Trained and tested on standard datasets with high accuracy models.

### **PART 2 â€“ Face Detection Models**
- Integrates face detection for preprocessing and real-time inference.
- Uses models like YOLOv8 and Haar Cascades.

### **PART 3 â€“ IoT Integration (Simulation & Practical)**
- Conceptual extension for real-world applications.
- Simulated use cases like Smart Classrooms, Patient Monitoring, etc.
